# Capturing Events In Cosmos DB
Return to [Ingesting events into Event Hubs](EventHubs.md).



---



In this section, we will create a Logic App to respond to each event being streamed through our Event Hub. We'll take the payload...
```json
{
    "name": "deposit",
    "current": 999,
    "timestamp": 1551465599,
    "previous": 1000,
    "initial": 1000
}
```
...and enrich it...
```json
{
    "event": {
        "name": "deposit",
        "current": 999,
        "timestamp": 1551465599,
        "previous": 1000,
        "initial": 1000
    },
    "id": "34634-5535768",
    "properties": {
        "x-opt-sequence-number": 34634,
        "x-opt-offset": "5535768",
        "x-opt-enqueued-time": "2019-03-01T18:39:59.942Z"
    }
}
```
...before persisting it in our Cosmos DB instance.

## Creating the Cosmos DB Store

1. Click on `Create a resource` and find `Azure Cosmos DB`.
  ![Create a resource](LogicApps/Cosmos/1.png)

1. Click `Create` at the bottom of the service summary.
  ![Create](LogicApps/Cosmos/2.png)

1. Fill in the service creation form, selecting the workshop's resource group and a location of your choosing. Give the service a globally unique name, and select `Core (SQL)` as the API. Click on `Review + create`.
  ![Review + create](LogicApps/Cosmos/3.png)

1. Upon successful validation, click `Create`, otherwise resolve the validation errors.
  ![Validation](LogicApps/Cosmos/4.png)

1. Once your Cosmos DB has finished deploying, head on over to the `Data Explorer` section. Click on `New Collection` from the blade on the right. A panel will appear on the far right. Give the database and the collection to be created a name, and set the collection's partition key to `/event/name`. Click `OK` once done.
  ![New collection](LogicApps/Cosmos/5.png)

## Creating the Logic App

1. Click `Create a resource` and find `Logic App`.
  ![Create a resource](LogicApps/Logic/1.png)

1. Click `Create` which appears at the bottom of the service summary.
  ![Create](LogicApps/Logic/2.png)

1. Give the Logic App a name, add it to the workshop's resource group, and select your preferred location. Click `Create` once done. Once the Logic App has deployed successfully, go to the resource.
  ![Form](LogicApps/Logic/3.png)

1. *If opening your Logic App didn't show you an introduction to Logic Apps, click on the `Edit` button from the `Overview` section of the Logic App.*
  ![Edit](LogicApps/Logic/4.png)

1. Select the `Blank Logic App` template.
  ![Blank Logic App](LogicApps/Logic/5.png)

1. Filter the triggers to only show those from `Event Hubs`. Select the `When events are available in Event Hub` trigger; this will allow the Logic App to execute each time an event is streamed through our Event Hub.
  ![Select trigger](LogicApps/Logic/6.png)

1. Give the connection a name of your choosing, and select the namespace associated to the Event Hub we created earlier.
  ![Event Hub connection](LogicApps/Logic/7.png)

1. Select the available access policy from the list presented to you, and click `Create`
  ![Event Hub policy](LogicApps/Logic/8.png)

1. Select the Event Hub we created earlier, and set the trigger to deserialize the data as `application/json`. Specify an interval at which to poll the Event Hub for new events, and hit `Save`.
  ![Config and save](LogicApps/Logic/9.png)

1. The `Overview` section of the Logic App should indicate that the Logic App has received and processed events (see the `Runs history` panel). If the `Runs history` isn't showing any activity, click the `Refresh` button located above the `Runs history` section.
  ![Runs history](LogicApps/Logic/10.png)

1. Clicking on an execution in the `Runs history` allows you to view more information about that run. All the actions in the Logic App will appear in a collapsed state with an icon indicating their success/failure; to expand an action to view more information, simply click on it. You should find that the `Content` of the Logic App trigger looks very similar to:
    ```json
    {
        "name": "deposit",
        "current": 999,
        "timestamp": 1551465599,
        "previous": 1000,
        "initial": 1000
    }
    ```
    ![Examine previous run](LogicApps/Logic/11.png)

## Enriching the Event Payload

1. Let's return to the Logic App editor by clicking `Edit` from the `Overview` section of the service.
  ![Edit](LogicApps/Enrich/1.png)

1. Click `+ New step` to add another action to our Logic App.
  ![New step](LogicApps/Enrich/2.png)

1. We are going to create a variable which will hold the value for our object's ID before persisting it into Cosmos DB. Find the `Variables` grouping and select `Initialize variable`.
  ![Initialize variable](LogicApps/Enrich/3.png)

1. Set the name of our variable to `ID`, type to `String`, and the value to `SequenceNumber-Offset`. The sequence number and offset can be obtained via the popup that appears after clicking on the value text field; if it doesn't automatically appear, click `Add dynamic content`. Click `+ New step` after.
  ![Set ID](LogicApps/Enrich/4.png)

1. Find the `Compose` action; we will use this to craft the JSON document that we want to persist.
  ![Find Composer](LogicApps/Enrich/5.png)

1. Update the input of the composer with JSON similar to...
    ```json
    {
        "event" : $content,
        "id" : $id,
        "properties" : $properties
    }
    ```
    ...where `$content`, `$id`, and `$properties` are replaced by the `Content` from the Event Hub trigger, the `ID` variable, and the `Properties` from the Event Hub trigger, respectively.
  ![Compose](LogicApps/Enrich/6.png)

1. Next, we're going to extract individual values from the `Content` from the Logic App's Event Hub trigger. This doesn't need to be performed sequential and can therefor be parallelized. Click on the `+` preceding our composed, then `Add a parallel branch`.
  ![Add a parallel branch](LogicApps/Enrich/7.png)

1. Find and select the `Parse JSON` action.
  ![Parse JSON](LogicApps/Enrich/8.png)

1. Set the Event Hub's `Content` as the value of the `Parse JSON` action's content. Will we use a sample/template of the payload to generate the JSON schema required by this action to extract the individual components; click on `Use sample payload to generate schema`.
  ![Set content](LogicApps/Enrich/9.png)

1. Paste in the following template (or similar) and click `Done`.
    ```json
    {
        "name": "deposit",
        "current": 999,
        "timestamp": 1551465599,
        "previous": 1000,
        "initial": 1000
    }
    ```
    ![Use sample payload to generate schema](LogicApps/Enrich/10.png)

1. Now we can persist our document into Cosmos DB. Click `+ New step`.
  ![New step](LogicApps/Enrich/11.png)

1. Find the Cosmos DB group, and select the `Create or update document` action.
  ![Create or update document](LogicApps/Enrich/12.png)

1. Provide a name for the connection to Cosmos DB, select the Cosmos DB instance, and hit `Create`.
  ![Connect to Cosmos DB](LogicApps/Enrich/13.png)

1. Select the database and collection where the document will be stored. Set the output of our `Compose` action from earlier as the document to persist.
  ![Select collection](LogicApps/Enrich/14.png)

1. Before we can successfully store our document, we need to let Cosmos DB know the value to use for partitioning. Click on `Add new parameter` and check the `Partition key value` item.
  ![Partition key value](LogicApps/Enrich/15.png)

1. Set the `Partition key value` to the `name` extracted via our `Parse JSON` action earlier. Be sure to enclose this value in double quotes: `"$name"`. Once done, feel free to `Save` your Logic App so that the changes we've made can take effect.
  ![Set partition key value](LogicApps/Enrich/16.png)

1. Feel free to inspect the recent execution via the `Runs history` section of the `Overview` blade. Remember, if the `Runs history` isn't showing any activity, click the `Refresh` button located above the `Runs history` section.
  ![Runs history](LogicApps/Enrich/17.png)

1. To inspect the save documents in Cosmos DB, head on over to the `Data Explorer` on your Cosmos DB resource. Select the database, the collection, then the `Documents` option. You will find a list of the persisted documents; click to view any of the documents to inspect. The document should look like this (with a few additional properties prefixed by an underscore):
    ```json
    {
        "event": {
            "name": "deposit",
            "current": 999,
            "timestamp": 1551465599,
            "previous": 1000,
            "initial": 1000
        },
        "id": "34634-5535768",
        "properties": {
            "x-opt-sequence-number": 34634,
            "x-opt-offset": "5535768",
            "x-opt-enqueued-time": "2019-03-01T18:39:59.942Z"
        }
    }
    ```
